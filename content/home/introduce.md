## Who We Are

The PolyU Edge Intelligence Laboratory (PEILab), directed by [Prof. Song Guo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cssongguo/), is developing novel and efficient deep learning architectures, algorithms, and systems over ubiquitous mobile, IoT, and wearable devices. Specific topics of current interest include edge on-device learning, federated learning, and implementation of large-scale deep neural networks in cloud-edge hybrid systems.

## Join Us

We are looking for strongly motivated PhD students, Research Assistants, and Postdoctoral Fellows.

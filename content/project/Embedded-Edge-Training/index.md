After nearly ten years of rapid development, machine learning technology has changed from a computationally intensive model that relies on cloud big data and massive computing resources to a more user-friendly operation form, emphasizing the application requirements of "efficient, green, safe, and personalized", Which evolved from Cloud AI to Mobile AI. 

At the same time, thanks to the improvement of chip manufacturing process and computing power, it will be possible to deploy AI applications on Microcontroller Units, which will greatly promote the implementation of Edge Intelligence and Green IoT. 

Therefore, industry and academia will usher in the era of Tiny AI. Among them, On-device Learning is the cutting-edge core technology that supports Tiny AI. The team is committed to the research of high-performance AI technology on microprocessors and edge mobile devices, focusing on the four-level collaborative design of "data, algorithm, hardware, and system" to create a new generation of AI systems for edge intelligence.

In order to cope with the challenges of population, resources, and environment to urban development, countries around the world have adopted the construction of "smart cities" as a brand-new urban development concept and practice path. 

With the widespread deployment of sensors, the Internet of Things, and cameras, it will help managers to have a more refined understanding of the real-time situation of the city, and improve the efficiency of urban traffic and safety management.

Traditional smart city applications usually need to upload data to the cloud, and analyze and process video and sensor data streams through the powerful computing power of the city's central brain. However, dangers and accidents in cities always emerge in endlessly. For example, accidents in traffic and construction sites often endanger the lives of citizens. In order to deal with such accidental risks, more timely crisis detection and response methods are needed.

In order to apply the challenges of low latency in urban risk management, the research team will use edge learning technology to realize real-time processing of video streams to deal with risk early warning and response in complex urban environments, such as early warning of traffic accidents and falling objects from high altitudes. 

The technologies used include: (1) a model compression strategy for edge devices; (2) a dynamic data compression strategy for context awareness; (3) a multi-device collaborative learning framework in a complex environment; (4) a quick response method. This research focuses on the problems in the application scenarios of smart cities. 

The research team will conduct in-depth cooperation with professors from the Department of Real Estate and the Department of Electronic Engineering to promote in-depth research on the security of construction sites based on risk management technology based on edge intelligence.

## Introduction

This talk will focus on the field of **Edge Learning**. Specifically, learning paradigms, fundamental theories, and enabling technologies for Edge Learning consist the main components of this tutorial. We will first explain the background and motivation for ML running at the network edge. Then, we will review the challenge issues existing in Edge Learning. Furthermore, we will provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for learning performance, security, privacy, and incentive issues toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we will discuss future research opportunities on Edge Learning.

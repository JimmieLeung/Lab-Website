# Keynote

#### Talk1:  **Computation Offloading and Task Scheduling on the Network Edge**

**Speaker:** Sherman Shen

**Abstract:** Next-generation wireless networks are anticipated to provide connectivity for massive mobile devices and to enable a variety of innovative applications, which also generate enormous computing service demands with diverse and stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), as cutting-edge technology in next-generation networks, can utilize computing resources on the network edge to provide computing services for mobile devices within a radio access network. In this talk, we will investigate computing resource management for MEC, We will introduce two computation offloading and task scheduling schemes tailored for supporting representative use cases and network scenarios in next-generation wireless networks, including the Internet of Vehicles and mobile virtual reality video streaming. Data-model-driven resource management approaches will be exploited to facilitate low-latency and reliable computing services in complex and dynamic network environments.





#### Talk3: **Task Scheduling for Multi-Access Edge Computing in IRS-Aided Vehicular Networks**

**Abstract:** Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has played an important role in realizing intelligent beyond 5G (B5G) vehicular networks. The computation tasks of intelligent applications can be offloaded to and processed by near-end-user MEC servers to meet strict latency requirements. However, the latency of provided services is dependent on MEC processor scheduling and millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission conditions for the urban B5G vehicular networks. To alleviate the mmWave signal attenuation caused by buildings, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been regarded as efficient and prospective infrastructure. In this paper, we study the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks and analyze the relationship between computation resource allocation and offloading policy at an intersection. Considering the vehicle mobility patterns, transmission conditions, and task sizes, we optimize the task scheduling by improving the allocation of limited processors and IRS resource. Moreover, the mutual interference among concurrent transmissions is taken into account. In this presentation, by assuming the moving directions available, a dynamic task scheduling algorithm is presented which considers both the communications and computations. The simulation results illustrate that the new scheme outperforms benchmark methods in terms of task offloading rate, computing rate, and finish rate for the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks.

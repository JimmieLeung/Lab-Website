## Keynote

#### Talk1:  **Computation Offloading and Task Scheduling on the Network Edge**

**Speaker:** Sherman Shen

**Abstract:** Next-generation wireless networks are anticipated to provide connectivity for massive mobile devices and to enable a variety of innovative applications, which also generate enormous computing service demands with diverse and stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), as cutting-edge technology in next-generation networks, can utilize computing resources on the network edge to provide computing services for mobile devices within a radio access network. In this talk, we will investigate computing resource management for MEC, We will introduce two computation offloading and task scheduling schemes tailored for supporting representative use cases and network scenarios in next-generation wireless networks, including the Internet of Vehicles and mobile virtual reality video streaming. Data-model-driven resource management approaches will be exploited to facilitate low-latency and reliable computing services in complex and dynamic network environments.

#### **Talk 2: Vehicle as a Service (VaaS): How to Leverage Vehicles to Beef Up the Edge** 

**Abstract:** Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and/or Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in general have attracted tremendous attention in recent years. They have been shown to be useful not only for traffic management and control, but also for diverse innovative applications to improve people’s quality of life. Observing that the most popular and omnipresent things in any city are vehicles, if each vehicle is equipped with powerful capability in communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (CCSI capability), such vehicles roaming around a city will automatically form a dynamic web of sensing, computing, communications, control, and/or edge intelligence, potentially providing an economically sound alternative solution to realizing the vision of smart city. In this talk, the speaker will discuss how to leverage connected CCSI enabled vehicles to take full advantage of both vehicular mobility and spectrum/computing  opportunity to beef up the edge for various kinds of smart city services.

#### Talk3: **Task Scheduling for Multi-Access Edge Computing in IRS-Aided Vehicular Networks**

**Abstract:** Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has played an important role in realizing intelligent beyond 5G (B5G) vehicular networks. The computation tasks of intelligent applications can be offloaded to and processed by near-end-user MEC servers to meet strict latency requirements. However, the latency of provided services is dependent on MEC processor scheduling and millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission conditions for the urban B5G vehicular networks. To alleviate the mmWave signal attenuation caused by buildings, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been regarded as efficient and prospective infrastructure. In this paper, we study the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks and analyze the relationship between computation resource allocation and offloading policy at an intersection. Considering the vehicle mobility patterns, transmission conditions, and task sizes, we optimize the task scheduling by improving the allocation of limited processors and IRS resource. Moreover, the mutual interference among concurrent transmissions is taken into account. In this presentation, by assuming the moving directions available, a dynamic task scheduling algorithm is presented which considers both the communications and computations. The simulation results illustrate that the new scheme outperforms benchmark methods in terms of task offloading rate, computing rate, and finish rate for the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks.

#### **Talk 4: AIoT as a Service – Framework, Opportunities, and Challenges**

With the increasing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and rapid advancements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, the integration of AI and IoT, widely referred as AIoT, is gaining momentum. Realizing AIoT will require massive investments in infrastructure, and lessons learned from network deployments point to the use of shared hardware and software resources that can be virtualized to support various services on demand, resulting in AIoT-as-a-Service (AIoTaaS). In this talk, we start with a review of the idea of Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS), leading to IoTaaS and AIaaS, which form the basis of AIoTaaS. We present a framework for AIoTaaS, which incorporates edge and cloud computing platforms to support the AI functionalities required for different services. Enabled by cloud and edge computing, AIoTaaS can effectively implement machine learning (ML) training and inference functions on cloud and edge devices with much less complexity to enable efficient and effective AI decision making in IoT and data analytics, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks. To implement AIoTaaS, interoperability between components at the device level, software level and platform level should be extended while optimizing system and network operations as well as extracting value from data. In the future, AIoTaaS integrated with 5G and blockchain will be leveraged to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions, and enhance data management and analytics, creating a foundation for pervasive AI services and applications.
